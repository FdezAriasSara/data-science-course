    "# Semantic search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use sentence embeddings to perform [semantic search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search). Semantic search can be defined as the process of retrieving the most relevant contexts based on a query, even if the query and the contexts are not exactly the same. This is different from keyword-based search, where the search engine looks for exact matches of the keywords in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilize the [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder) (USE) model by Google to encode both questions and contexts/answers (paragraphs) as embeddings. USE is a pre-trained model that generates semantic embeddings for small to medium-sized text inputs. Then, using a question/answer dataset, we perform semantic search to retrieve the most relevant contexts based on a query. We search for similarity between the encodings of the query and both the contexts and questions, and return the most relevant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notice*: USE is a relatively lightweight model that provides good performance. For better embeddings but slower performance, transformer-based models like [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) (Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) dataset. SQuAD is one of the most widely used datasets for question-answering tasks. It consists of questions posed by crowdworkers on Wikipedia articles, with the corresponding answers as text spans within the articles."

      "\tContext: By the 1900s, nigger had become a pejorative word in the United States. In its stead, the term colored became the mainstream alternative to negro and its derived terms. After the African-American Civil rights movement, the terms colored and negro gave way to \"black\". Negro had superseded colored as the most polite word for African Americans at a time when black was considered more offensive. This term was accepted as normal, including by people classified as Negroes, until the later Civil Rights movement in the late 1960s. One well-known example is the identification by Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. of his own race as \"Negro\" in his famous speech of 1963, I Have a Dream. During the American Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, some African-American leaders in the United States, notably Malcolm X, objected to the word Negro because they associated it with the long history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination that treated African Americans as second-class citizens, or worse. Malcolm X preferred Black to Negro, but later gradually abandoned that as well for Afro-American after leaving the Nation of Islam.\n",
