    "In the notebook, we limited the data loaded into memory to avoid memory issues. However, deep models have plenty of parameters to be learned from lots of data. This generates a problem: we need to load the data into memory to train the model, but we cannot load all the data at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve that problem, mini-batches are used to lazily load the data in small chunks. The `fit` method allows us to pass a generator that yields the data in small chunks (mini-batches). In this way, we do not need to load the whole dataset into memory at once. This technique is very important when dealing with large datasets (big data), very common when training deep learning models."

    "Answer: The model has more training data. Another secondary reason is that we use a bigger vocabulary size, and hence there are fewer OOV tokens.\n",
    "3. When do you think you will need to train a model in this way?\n",
    "Answer: When the dataset is too large to fit in memory. That would be the case of deep models."
